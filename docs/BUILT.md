# BUILT — shipped features

How each non-obvious feature of the movement was designed and why: written
before it was built, then reconciled against the code after it shipped.
Source comments cite these by section number — `BUILT §7` in `src/main.js`
is §7 below. The numbering is non-contiguous because it is the original
filing order, kept stable so those references stay valid.

For the *mechanical-realism* debt list — honesty fixes to what already
exists, as opposed to new capability — see `../TODO.md`.

Every feature here inherited the project's standing rules: constants DERIVED
from constraints with the constraint written in a comment (`CLEAR_MARGIN =
0.15` is the one margin), every new part declared in `MECH_GRAPH`, and the
full inspector battery clean before landing (support 0 failures, graph
clean, penetration within budgets, clearances 0 violations, full
`inspection {includeExcluded:true}` 0 FORBIDDEN). Any part placed near the
low corridor must consume `LOW_LINKAGE_OBSTACLES` — the single source for
that band's swept footprint.

## 1. Jumping-minute setting (BUILT — PRs #28/#29)

**Goal.** Pair the existing seconds zero-reset with minute-perfect
setting: pull the crown → balance hacks and the seconds hand flies to
zero (already built); turn the crown → the minute hand advances in
whole-minute DETENTED jumps; push at the reference tick → the watch
restarts exactly synchronized. This is *setting-time* jumping only —
the running display stays continuous, so the jumper must engage only
while the crown is out.

**Why it also pays debt.** Building it properly closes `TODO.md` item 3:
the star's input angle is computed FORWARD from the crown's rotation
through the real setting-path tooth counts, replacing the assigned
`handSetOffset`.

### Mechanism

- **Star wheel**: 60-point star fixed to the MINUTE WHEEL (dial side —
  the motion works: cannon pinion → minute wheel → minute pinion → hour
  wheel; `MW_*` constants are hoisted at the top of `main.js`). One
  star point per minute of minute-hand travel; note the minute wheel
  turns once per ~3 h (cannon 3:1), so the star has 60 points per
  MINUTE-HAND minute = 180 points per wheel turn ÷ the 3:1 — derive the
  count from the actual `MW_*` tooth ratios, don't assume (acceptance
  test below pins it).
- **Jumper**: sprung detent lever (arm + rounded beak + return spring,
  date-jumper pattern; reuse the click/lyre-spring build styles) pivoted
  on the base plate's DIAL face near the minute wheel, beak seated
  between star points.
- **Engagement lifter**: the jumper only touches the star when the
  crown is OUT. Drive the lift off the existing setting-lever/yoke gang
  (the same eased `crownPullT` machinery that shifts the sliding
  pinion): crown in → jumper lifted clear by one margin; crown out →
  beak dropped into the star. One more finger on the setting lever, no
  new input path.
- **Friction**: setting slips through the cannon pinion's friction
  coupling exactly as today; the star/jumper sits downstream on the
  minute wheel, so a snap never back-drives the train.

### Implementation steps

1. **geometry.js**: `makeStarWheel({ points, radius, thickness })`
   (symmetric points — the ratchet builder's saw teeth are wrong here)
   and `makeJumper({ reach, thickness })` (pivot-origined arm + beak,
   0-based extrude, caller aims it — `makeClick`'s conventions).
2. **main.js placement**: star on the minute wheel's arbor at the
   `Z_SETTING`-adjacent plane; jumper pivot seat SOLVED by obstacle scan
   (pillar-scan pattern) against the dial-side set: keyless envelope,
   motion works, reserve train, dial feet, and the setting arbor's
   traverse. Beak-in-valley registration snapped to the star pitch
   (the detent/pawl precedent).
3. **Kinematics (tick)**: derive
   `starInput = setPathRot · (windPinion/settingWheel) · (…minuteArbor
   compound…) · (…to minute wheel)` from the declared tooth counts —
   this replaces `handSetOffset`'s assignment (TODO #3). Displayed
   minute-wheel angle while the jumper is engaged =
   `quantize(starInput, pitch)` with an eased snap (the `CAM_SNAP_TAU`
   convention); jumper beak animates with the geometric ride formula
   (measured seat + profile, lift sign derived — the pawl/detent
   precedent). On crown push-in, the jumper lifts and normal creep
   resumes from the snapped phase; seconds restart is already handled
   by `secondsZeroRef`.
4. **inspect.js**: unit `'Minute jumper'` — support
   `['Minute jumper','plate']` (dial-face pivot stud), drive
   `['Setting lever','Minute jumper']` (the lifter) and
   `['Keyless works','Motion works']` (existing); EXPECTED
   `['Minute jumper','Motion works']` (beak in the star); clearance
   budgets vs Dial, Keyless works, Hour wheel.
5. **Boot asserts**: beak seats in a valley within tolerance; the
   lifter's stroke actually clears the star by the margin at crown-in;
   the derived star pitch × points ≡ one minute-hand minute (ratio
   identity, printed if violated).

### Acceptance criteria

- Pull crown: seconds → 0 and hack (existing behavior unchanged);
  minute hand sits exactly on a minute index (jumper seats it).
- Turning the crown in setting mode advances the minute hand in clean
  single-minute snaps, both directions; the hour hand follows through
  the real 12:1.
- `handSetOffset` no longer assigned in `tick()` — TODO #3 moves to
  "Recently closed".
- Full battery clean; boot silent; jumper visible on the sapphire-dial
  side (it becomes display-side furniture — make it pretty).

## 6. Dial x-ray — dial goes transparent with the 3/4 plate (BUILT)

**Goal.** When Plate X-ray is on, the dial also goes glassy so the
dial-side works (keyless, motion works, reserve train, §1's minute
jumper) are visible from the front — effectively a live preview of
§3's sapphire dial.

**Mechanism.** `setXray` currently swaps ONE mesh's material
(`tqPlateMesh`, solid ⇄ pre-built `tqXrayMat` clone). The dial is not
one mesh: `makeDial` builds a disc (unique canvas-textured
`MeshPhysicalMaterial`), chapter ring (`MATS.silver`), per-subdial
recessed floors (unique canvas materials), well walls (one shared
`wallMat`), and applied markers (`MATS.steel`) — plus the dial feet
in `dialGroup`. So the single-clone pattern generalizes to a
one-time traverse of `dialGroup` building a `Map<origMat, xrayClone>`
(transparent, opacity ≈ the plate's 0.28, `depthWrite: false`,
roughness nudged glassward), and `setXray` swaps every cached mesh
both ways. Ride the SAME button and the same persisted `plateXray`
flag — the request is "when the plate is transparent", not a second
toggle.

**Risks.** Coplanar transparency sorting (markers/ring sit on the
disc with `depthWrite` off — expect some draw-order shimmer, same
regime the plate already accepts); hands and subdial hands are
`dialFace` siblings, not dial children, so they correctly stay
opaque. Keep the traverse scoped to the `Dial` unit's group so
shared `MATS.steel`/`MATS.silver` clones never leak to other parts.

**Relationship to §3.** This is §3's preview: the sapphire dial makes
the dial-side show permanent and pretty; this toggle proves the view
is worth building. If §3 lands with a real transparent dial material,
this clone set is subsumed and can be deleted.

Feasibility: small · Cost: ~40–60 lines in `main.js` (clone-cache
traverse + `setXray` extension), 0 new parts, 1 derived constant at
most (shared opacity with `tqXrayMat`) · Battery: material-only —
boot + visual check only.

**Acceptance.** X-ray on: motion works, keyless, reserve train and
jumper readable through the dial from the front camera; x-ray off:
dial pixel-identical to today; toggle round-trips with no material
leak onto non-dial parts (spot-check a train wheel and the crown).

## 7. Per-unit explode selector (+ label filtering) (BUILT)

**Goal.** Pick one component group and lift only it, so a single
unit's kinematics can be inspected without the full-stack explode —
and, as a side benefit, show only that unit's label.

**Verdict on complexity (this was the user's condition):** not much
more complex than the existing explode — small/medium, UI-only.

**Mechanism.** `explodeEntries` ({obj, baseZ, layer, dir}) already
holds per-unit records and `updateExplode` is a 3-line loop —
filtering is one condition. The missing piece is NAMES: `registerExplode`
takes none. But most explode `obj`s are the very same objects passed
to `registerLabel` (barrelArbor, centerArbor, … dialGroup, handsGroup
excepted), so a one-time identity join against `labelEntries`
(`labelEntries.find(e => e.obj === entry.obj)`, falling back to an
ancestor walk) names nearly every entry without touching the ~30
`registerExplode` call sites. Unmatched entries (`backPlate`,
layer 0) group as "Structure". UI: a `<select>` (or the presets-row
button style) listing "All" + the joined names; `updateExplode`
lifts only matching entries when a unit is chosen. Label filtering:
`updateLabels` loops `labelEntries` — hide entries whose name isn't
the selected unit (one condition; "All" keeps today's behavior).

**Risks.** A lone unit lifting while neighbors stay home WILL pass
through the three-quarter plate / dial on its way out — display-only,
but visually cheap-looking; mitigation is one line (when a unit is
selected, also lift `threeQuarterPlate`/`dialGroup` per their
existing entries, or auto-enable Plate X-ray). The chain registers
its label lazily on first tick (`labelEls` grows in `updateLabels`),
so build the selector list lazily or refresh it on open. No
MECH_GRAPH impact: nothing new exists, nothing moves in sim space.

Feasibility: small/medium · Cost: ~80–120 lines in `main.js`
(identity join, selector UI, two filter conditions), 0 new parts,
0 derived constants · Battery: no geometry — boot + visual check
only (verify the inspector's pose sweeps are unaffected: explode is
render-side and already excluded).

**Acceptance.** Selecting a unit lifts exactly that unit's entries
by the slider amount, all others home; "All" reproduces today's
explode bit-for-bit; with a unit selected and Labels on, only that
unit's label renders; selector includes the lazily-registered Chain
once it exists; plate pass-through mitigated (x-ray or co-lift).

## 8. Sound — synthesized clicks off the existing discrete events (BUILT — PR #30)

**Goal.** The movement makes its noises: the escapement's tic-toc,
the maintaining pawls' click-click while winding, the minute jumper's
snap during setting, the reset hammer's thunk and the crown's stem
click — all synthesized (no audio assets), all derived from state
`tick()` already computes every frame.

**Mechanism.** No loops; hook DISCRETE edges off the continuous
phases, one module-level "last index" per source:

- *Escapement beat* — `beatPhase(tau).n` increments (`F_BALANCE =
  2.5` Hz → 5 beats/s, 18,000 vph). Alternate two timbres by `n`
  parity — that parity is already the fork's bank side
  (`forkBankAt(n)`), so the tic/toc alternation is mechanically
  honest for free.
- *Maintaining pawls (winding)* — in `updateMaintaining(windBack)`
  the pawl tooth-phase `u = ((MAINT_PAWL_TIP_AZ − windBack)·
  MAINT_TEETH / 2π) mod 1` wraps once per tooth passage; each wrap
  is one snap. The two pawls sit π apart = exactly 12 pitches
  (`MAINT_TEETH = 24`), so they land in unison — one click event,
  not two. Detect in `tick()` (which owns `windBack`) rather than
  widening `updateMaintaining`'s signature.
- *Maintaining detent (running)* — same formula on the detent's
  `net = barrelArbor.rotation.z − MAINT_DETENT_AZ`; the barrel turns
  1 rev/8 h, so 24 teeth → one soft tick per 20 minutes of movement
  time. Nearly an easter egg; costs three lines, keep it.
- *Minute jumper (setting)* — while `jmpEngaged` (`crownPullT >
  0.5`), the quantized `target` in the jumping-minute block steps by
  `MIN_PITCH = 2π/60`; each index change is one snap (the eased
  `jumpDisp` follow-through on `CAM_SNAP_TAU` is the visual half of
  the same event).
- *Reset hammer + crown* — `crownOut` flips in `setCrownOut` (stem
  click, both directions); the hammer's fall is `leverEngage`
  crossing a threshold (~0.85) on the way up — one thunk per pull.

*Synthesis*: WebAudio, one lazy `AudioContext` — per event, a short
noise burst through a bandpass into an exponential-decay gain
(center frequency/Q/decay per source: beat ~4 kHz/6 ms, pawl
~2.5 kHz/10 ms, jumper ~3 kHz, hammer ~1.2 kHz/25 ms — tuned by
ear). Zero asset files. Autoplay policy: create/`resume()` the
context on first `pointerdown` (the crown-drag handler and panel
buttons are existing gestures).

*UI*: one panel row "Sound" in the `btn-xray` toggle pattern,
**default Off**. Default-Off also keeps `__clock.step`-driven
inspector/automated runs silent for free. Optionally persist the
toggle via `captureState`/`saveState` like `plateXray`.

*Fast-forward*: `fastForward` runs 45 coarse 2 s ticks per frame
(~5400×) — beats would be a ~27 k events/s buzz. Suppress all sound
events while `fastForward` is set (winding/setting can't happen in
FF anyway). The `timeScale` slider maxes at 1×, so FF is the only
fast case to gate.

*Hidden pane*: rAF suspension stops `frame()` → `tick()` → no edges
→ silence falls out naturally; there are no loops to pause. The
transients are ≤ tens of ms, so nothing meaningfully outlives the
last frame.

**Risks.** A clamped-but-large `rawDt` (tab restore: 0.25 s) can
step several beats in one tick — cap sounds scheduled per tick (say
3) and spread them over the stride via `ctx.currentTime` offsets,
so a hiccup never machine-guns. Multiple agents' shared-checkout
port caching doesn't apply (no new module files needed if the synth
lives in `main.js`; a separate `src/audio.js` is fine too but mind
the preview browser's module sub-import caching).

Feasibility: small · Cost: ~120–180 lines in `main.js` (synth ~40,
five edge detectors ~40, gesture/resume + panel row ~30, FF gating
+ per-tick cap ~15), 0 new parts, 0 geometry, no MECH_GRAPH entries,
no derived clearance constants · Battery: no geometry — boot +
visual check only (plus confirm an `inspection` run with sound Off
stays silent).

**Acceptance.** Sound On + running: 5 alternating clicks/s that stay
phase-locked to the visible pallet events; hack the balance (pull
the crown) → beats stop with it. Winding: one click per flange tooth
passage, in step with the visible pawl hops; silent while the crown
is idle. Crown pull → stem click + hammer thunk; each detent step
while setting → one snap, matching the hand's jumps. Fast-forward →
silence. Sound Off (default) → the app is bit-for-bit silent,
including `__clock.step` runs; no AudioContext is created until the
toggle is first switched On.

## 9. Dial epoch (boot at 1:51) + "Sync to now" button (BUILT)

**Goal.** The watch boots showing 1:51:00 instead of 12:00:00, and one
panel button sets the display to the viewer's wall clock.

**Why 12:00 today.** The hands are zero-referenced against `centerAt0`
(`minuteA = centerAngle(tau) − centerAt0 + handSetOffset`, `main.js`
~5608), so τ = 0 reads noon by construction. The epoch is therefore
one constant folded into that reference — and it is the honest one:
hands are friction-fit on their arbors at whatever angle the fitter
chooses, so a `DIAL_EPOCH` offset is a real thing a real watch has.

*Rejected alternative*: starting `tauIntegrated` at 6660 s. It would
claim 1 h 51 m of running against a full barrel (`barrelWindTurns`
defaults to 3.75, integrated separately) and a beat count of zero —
three readouts disagreeing about the same history.

**The readout is already wrong, and this exposes it.** `main.js` ~5868
prints `formatTime(tauIntegrated)` — raw movement time, ignoring
`handSetOffset`. So *today*, setting the time with the crown moves the
hands and leaves the panel behind. Fix it once here: a
`displayedTime(tau, handSetOffset)` helper deriving seconds from the
SAME offset the hands use (sign derived from `centerAngle`'s −2π per
hour, not guessed), rendered 12-hour to match the dial it mirrors.

**Sync mechanism.** The setting path is the only honest input, and it
is already a forward derivation: `rawSetOffset = −minuteArborSpin ·
(minutePinionTeeth / cannonPinionTeeth)` (~5576) comes from
`crownRotation` through real tooth counts. So invert that same chain
to solve the Δ`crownRotation` that lands the hands on the target, and
write it — programmatic writes to `crownRotation` are established
practice (the auto-wind block, ~5478). The setting path only engages
with the crown out, so the button pulls the crown, applies, pushes in;
the pull hacks and zeroes the seconds for free, and the push folds the
snap into `jumpCorr`, so §1's jumper lands the minute hand on an index.

**The seconds problem (the interesting half).** A real watch cannot
*set* seconds, only zero them — the reset hammer. Two levels were
filed here: **(a)** instant, assigning `secondsZeroRef` to the wall
clock's seconds, and **(b)** the watchmaker's procedure — set to the
NEXT whole minute, wait, push in on the tick — perfectly honest but
costing the user up to 60 s of waiting.

**BUILT: neither.** A third route removes the choice. Set to the
**previous** whole minute, push in, and let the watch **catch up** —
run it fast until it agrees with the wall clock. Aiming BACKWARDS is
what buys everything: the jumper quantizes the display to whole
minutes while the crown is out anyway, so a minute that has already
passed leaves a deficit that is always positive and always under a
minute, and there is nothing to wait for. (a) needed two assignments
(`secondsZeroRef`, plus `jumpCorr` for the sub-minute residual, which
the jumper discards by design). (b) needed none but sat idle for up to
a minute. **The catch-up needs none and waits for nothing**: the hand
movement travels the gears as a write to `crownRotation`, and the
catch-up is time-scale — a rate this app already treats as a
first-class user-facing control. Catch-up law and its constraint live
in `main.js`; sound is suppressed during it for the same reason
fast-forward suppresses it.

**Drift.** A synced clock at anything below 1× is wrong again within
seconds, so Sync snaps the scale to 1× (and refuses under
`fastForward`). The scale now DEFAULTS to 1×, so that snap is a
no-op unless the viewer has moved the slider. τ still
stops when the balance hacks or the barrel runs down: this is a
one-shot correction, not a slave loop. Optional: a "drift +N s"
readout next to the time, which makes the mainspring's rate error
legible instead of embarrassing.

**Persistence gap (CLOSED).** `state.js` `sanitize()` carried
`crownRotation` and `tauIntegrated` but not `jumpCorr`, so a folded
setting correction was silently lost on reload (bounded by half a
minute of hand travel, but visible). `jumpCorr` now rides
`defaultState`/`sanitize`/`captureState`, read back with `?? 0` so
states saved before this survive. `secondsZeroRef` was never needed —
nothing assigns it.

### What was built

1. `DIAL_EPOCH_S` / `DIAL_EPOCH_ANGLE`, folded into `minuteA` only —
   not into `centerAt0`, which also feeds the gear mesh offsets, and
   not into `handSetOffset`, which drives setting-path furniture that
   has no business carrying a hand-fitting angle. Boot assert that the
   epoch is a whole number of minutes, or the jumper's index grid and
   the dial disagree.
2. `displayedSeconds()` + a 12-hour `formatTime`; the readout reads it
   instead of raw `tauIntegrated`. `__clock.displayTime` / `.dialEpoch`
   expose it, since τ alone cannot be checked against the dial once the
   crown has been turned.
3. `HAND_RAD_PER_SET_RAD` — the setting chain as one coefficient, so
   the solve can invert it, asserted at boot against the same forward
   chain `tick()` walks.
4. The sync script (`syncStart`/`syncUpdate`, phases pull → settle →
   push → catchup) and its catch-up law; `setTimeScale(1)` on start.
   Cancelled by the crown button, a crown drag, the scale slider or
   pause — a hand on the controls outranks the script.
5. One state field (`jumpCorr`), not three.
6. Panel row `Sync / Now`, disabled under fast-forward and pause.

Cost as built: ~150 lines in `main.js`, 6 in `state.js`, 0 new parts,
0 geometry, no `MECH_GRAPH` entries · Battery: no geometry — boot +
visual only; `__clock` pose-driven inspector runs are unaffected
(`setPose` ticks with zero dt, which the jumper's ease respects).

**Acceptance (met unless noted).** Cold boot with no saved state:
hands read 1:51:00, `displayTime − τ = 6660` exactly and still exactly
at τ = 3600, and the panel readout agrees with the hands. Setting-path
inversion moves the hands +600 s and −180 s exactly as asked. Sync
lands the minute hand on the wall clock's previous index, then closes
the remaining deficit by catching up — NOT "within one frame", and the
minute hand creeps off its index as it does, which is what a running
watch does. The scale reads 1× afterwards. Manual crown setting now
moves the readout with the hands. Sound stays Off by default and is
suppressed during the catch-up.

*Not verified:* that 1:51 does not mask the small-seconds or
power-reserve subdials — the framing rationale for the pose. Needs a
look from the `Dial` preset.
*Not measurable under automation:* end-to-end convergence timing. The
preview pane only renders during screenshots, so the wall-clock gap
grows faster than the catch-up closes it. The law was confirmed at
both ends (21.0× at its cap, 1.2× at a 0.12 s gap) and one convergence
was observed while frames were briefly live.

## 12. Time-scale readout — `1×` at the top, how slow below it (BUILT)

**Goal.** The scale readout currently prints a bare number
(`0.15×`) that means nothing without knowing where the slider's ends
are. At the top of the slider `1×` says everything it needs to — no
"real time" gloss, the symbol IS the statement. Every position below
it should say how slow it actually is.

**What the slider already is.** `SCALE_MIN = 0.02, SCALE_MAX = 1`, log
mapped over 0–1000 (`main.js` ~4835–4853), so the right end is exactly
1×. The whole feature is the two lines that write
`scaleValueEl.textContent` (initial + `input` handler); factor them
into one `formatScale(timeScale)` and there is exactly one place to
change. Note the top should read `1×`, not `1.00×`: the current
`toFixed(2)` is what makes the unity case look like a measurement
instead of a statement.

**What the descriptor should be derived from, not adjectives.** Two
honest facts, both already computable:

- *The ratio*: `1 / timeScale` → "6.7× slow". Direct, and it is the
  number a viewer needs to convert what they see into real seconds.
- *The beat*: `2 · F_BALANCE · timeScale` beats/s (5/s at 1×, from the
  constant §8 already hooks). This is the fact that MATTERS at these
  settings — around 0.15× is roughly where the escapement's
  unlock-impulse-drop sequence becomes followable by eye, and a readout
  of "0.75 beats/s" says that better than any adjective could. (The
  scale later defaulted to 1×: the movement should boot running at the
  speed it claims to run at, and slowing it down is then the viewer's
  deliberate act rather than a state they have to notice and undo.)

Suggested rendering, in the panel's existing two-tier style: the
`readout` line stays terse (`1×` at the top, `0.15× — 6.7× slow`
below) with the beat rate on the `label-small` line beneath it. Resist
a lookup table of words ("glacial", "study", "brisk"): the numbers are
derived, the words would be invented, and this project's standing rule
is that constants come from constraints.

**Two edges worth getting right.**

- *Detecting the top.* The unity case is the one that renders
  differently — bare `1×`, descriptor suppressed — so it has to be
  detected exactly. `sliderToScale(1000)` is `0.02 · 50^1`, which in
  floating point can land at 1.0000000000000002: do NOT compare the
  scale to 1 with `===` or invent an epsilon. Test the slider's
  integer position against its max, which is exact.
- *A THIRD edge, found in testing.* One notch below the top the scale
  is 0.9961, which `toFixed(2)` rounds to `1.00×` — the readout
  claiming a unity that position does not have, beside a slow-ratio
  that rounds to `1.0× slow` and says nothing. Unity is a distinct
  state here, so that case gains a digit (`0.996×`) rather than
  borrowing the top's identity, and the ratio clause drops out once it
  rounds to 1.0. Built that way.
- *Fast-forward outranks the slider.* `fastForward` steps ~5400×
  independently of `timeScale` (§8's note), so while FF is on a label
  reading "0.15× — 6.7× slow" is simply false. The readout must defer
  to FF (`fast-forward — 5400×`, or grey the slider) whenever it is
  engaged. Same for `paused`.

**Relationship to §9.** Sync-to-now snaps the scale to 1×; this label
is how the user sees that happen and understands why it had to.

Feasibility: trivial · Cost: ~20–30 lines in `main.js` (one
`formatScale` helper, two call sites collapsed into it, FF/pause
deference, one derived beat-rate expression), 0 new parts, 0 geometry,
0 new constants · Battery: none — boot + visual check.

**Acceptance.** Slider at maximum: reads `1×` and nothing else — no
gloss, no trailing zeros — and that rendering appears at the slider's
max position exactly (no float epsilon). Anywhere below: reads the
scale AND its slow-down ratio, with
the beat rate legible nearby; at the 0.15× default the beat rate reads
0.75 beats/s and matches the balance the user is watching. Fast-forward
on: the readout says so instead of reporting the slider. Paused: the
readout does not claim the movement is running at any rate.

## 11. Spatial sound — distance and direction for the click track (BUILT)

**Goal.** §8's click track comes from everywhere at once. The movement's
noises should come from WHERE the parts are: zoom out and it gets
quieter, orbit past the escapement and its tic-toc moves between the
ears.

**Mechanism, as built.** Every `sndClick(freq, q, decay, gain, when,
emitter)` call in `main.js` (~5515) now takes an optional sixth
argument, a `THREE.Object3D` already in scope at the call site — no new
emitter registry, since the six timbre wrappers in `SND` already close
over the objects they need: `forkGroup` for the beat, `maintDetent` for
both the winding pawls and the running detent tick (the pawls aren't
separately named objects, so their carrier stands in), `jumperUnit` for
the minute snap, `hammerGroup` for the reset thunk, and `crown` for the
stem click.

- *Direction.* `sndSpatial(emitter)` takes `v = worldPos −
  camera.position`, reads `cameraRight` off `camera.matrixWorld`'s
  first column, and clamps `v̂ · right` into a `StereoPannerNode`
  inserted between the per-click gain and the master chain. Equal-power
  panning, not an HRTF `PannerNode` — the camera framing already gives
  front/back and elevation cues, an HRTF panner would only buy those on
  headphones.
- *Distance.* The inverse law `gain = ref/(ref + rolloff·(d−ref))`,
  clamped to ≤ 1. `ref` is NOT a guessed number: it's the Escapement
  camera preset's own framing radius (cluster radius × 3.8 — the same
  rule `camTargets` uses), so the default view plays every §8 level
  exactly as tuned. `rolloff` is solved so the orbit's far limit
  (`controls.maxDistance = plateR·12`) lands at −25 dB rather than
  silence; the near limit (`plateR·0.35`) is what the ≤ 1 clamp exists
  to protect.
- *Snapshot timing.* A source can't move during its own ≤30 ms
  transient, so spatialization is captured once, synchronously, inside
  `sndClick` — not deferred to `audioCtx.currentTime + when`. The one
  wrinkle: three.js only recomputes `matrixWorld` at render time, and
  up to 12 fixed ticks can run per displayed frame, so reading a
  moving part's world position mid-tick without forcing an update
  would read last frame's pose. `movement.updateMatrixWorld(true)` runs
  once at the top of the sound edge-detection block in `tick()`
  (~6272), before any emitter positions are sampled that tick.
- *Master chain.* One `GainNode` → one `DynamicsCompressorNode` →
  `audioCtx.destination`, built lazily in `ensureAudioGraph()` alongside
  the `AudioContext` itself (same gesture-gated creation as before). All
  per-click panners connect into the master gain rather than the
  destination directly. The compressor exists because a beat cluster
  (three impacts) can land on top of a pawl click at near field; the
  gain node is also where a future volume slider would hook in.

**Dial-side occlusion, built without a hardcoded emitter list.** The
backlog's original mechanism ("a lowpass whose cutoff falls with the
dot product against the dial normal", tied to the x-ray flag) shipped
in a simpler form once actual part positions were checked: every
going-train pinion sets `position.z = 0` (`greatWheel`, `centerPinion`,
`thirdPinion`, `fourthPinion`, `escapePinion`), so world Z=0 IS the
plate baseline, and `movement` carries no rotation (`scene.add(movement)`
with none set), so world Z already is the stacking axis — no matrix
work needed. `sndSpatial` compares `emitterWorldZ * camera.position.z`:
opposite signs means the plate sits between the camera and the source,
so it gets muffled (a `BiquadFilterNode` lowpass, plus a mild gain
multiplier) unless x-ray has made the plate/dial glassy. Checking the
actual numbers first paid off: `hammerGroup`'s Z resolves to ≈+2.19
(front/train side, alongside the escapement) even though the backlog's
Risks section had grouped "jumper, keyless, hammer" together as
dial-side sources — that would have been a confidently wrong hardcoded
list (§10's own lesson). Computing each emitter's real Z instead means
the rule is fully general and symmetric: the escapement gets muffled
too, correctly, if you view it from deep on the dial's own side.
Tuning note: the first cutoff (900 Hz) nearly silenced everything, since
the `SND` timbres center as high as 5200 Hz and a narrow-Q bandpass
transient has almost nothing left below a cutoff that far under its
center — muffled has to still be clearly a SOUND, not a dropout. Settled
at 2400 Hz (above every source's low body tone) plus a 0.65× gain dip,
tuned by ear after a first pass read as broken rather than muffled.

**Sound-event highlight (not in the original backlog — added during
build).** The user asked, mid-implementation, for the part making a
sound to visibly light up. First pass was a separate glow-sprite
tracking each emitter's world position, added specifically to dodge a
real hazard: these parts' materials are shared scene-wide via `MATS.*`
and ALSO independently owned by the power-flow view (`pfApply`, which
lazily clones and tints `forkGroup`/`maintDetent`/`windSpinner`'s
meshes while it's on) — mutating emissive directly looked like it would
fight that feature for the same material slot. The overlay read as an
alarming floating blob, so it was replaced with what was actually
wanted: a direct emissive tint on the part's own cloned material
(lazy-cloned per mesh, first flash only), which turned out fine to
accept the power-flow overlap rather than engineer around it — two
optional, user-toggled features occasionally trading the last write
within one frame on `forkGroup`/`maintDetent`/`crown`'s materials is a
minor, accepted cosmetic edge case, not a crash; `jumperUnit` and
`hammerGroup` sit outside every power-flow group so they never see it
at all. Real-time decay (`SND_FLASH_DECAY`, 0.35 s) via `updateSndFlash`
in `frame()`, independent of `timeScale` — same reasoning as
`CAM_SNAP_TAU`.

**Deliberately deferred, not built.** The master volume slider was
scoped as optional in the original entry and stayed out of this pass —
the master `GainNode` it would drive already exists.

Cost as built: ~150 lines in `main.js` (master chain ~10, spatial +
occlusion helpers/constants ~45, `sndClick`/`SND` signature changes
~30, `updateMatrixWorld` forcing call ~5, sound-event highlight
~45–60), 0 new parts, 0 geometry, no `MECH_GRAPH` entries (the
highlight touches no new scene-graph nodes — it retints existing
meshes in place) · Battery: no geometry — boot + listening/looking
check only.

**Acceptance (met).** Boot console stays clean (no new warnings).
Orbiting around the movement with Sound On moves the beat between
channels, reversing as the camera crosses the escapement's axis.
Zooming from near to far drops the level smoothly without hitting
silence at the far limit. Switching between the Escapement and Dial
camera presets makes dial-side sources (jumper, crown) noticeably
duller from the train side without going silent, and un-mutes when
x-ray is on. Each click reads as a brief, subtle warm glint on the part
that made it. Sound Off and fast-forward remain exactly as silent as
§8 built them — neither code path changed.

## 5. "See the minute jumper in action" — Setting preset + guided demo (BUILT)

**Goal.** One click frames the §1 jumping-minute works and walks the
pull → snap → set → push cycle, so the mechanism sells itself instead of
hiding on the dial side. Two independently shippable halves — a camera
preset and a scripted demo — that share nothing new mechanically: the demo
is a *scripted user*, driving the same inputs a viewer would.

### Half 1 — the `Setting` camera preset

- A fifth `data-cam` button in the presets row (`src/main.js` ~5040) and a
  `Setting` entry in `camTargets` (~5994). The button wiring was already
  generic (`goToPreset` reads `dataset.cam`), so this is one object literal
  and one line of markup — as the plan scoped it.
- **Target derived, not eyeballed.** The whole cluster — star, beak,
  spring, lifter — lives within `JMP_PIV_R` of the minute-wheel stud, so the
  stud IS the frame's centre. Its world position comes through the `dialFace`
  Y-flip (`dialFace.rotation.y = π` ⇒ dial-local `(x,y,z)` ↔ world
  `(P.dial.x − x, P.dial.y + y, Z_DIAL − z)`): target
  `(P.dial.x − MW_STUD.x, P.dial.y + MW_STUD.y, Z_DIAL − STAR_MID)`. Framing
  radius `R = JMP_PIV_R + STAR_R`, camera `3.8×R` off the target by the same
  42° FOV fit rule the other presets use (documented in the `camTargets`
  header), on the −Z (dial) side like the `Dial` preset.
- **Why the dial side, and `reveal: 'xray'`.** The jumper sits *between* the
  dial and the plate (mesh Z ≈ −4.6…−6.7 against the dial at Z_DIAL = −7), so
  from the dial side the only thing occluding it is the thin dial — from the
  movement side the entire going train and barrel would. So the frame is
  dial-side, and the preset carries `reveal: 'xray'`; `goToPreset` honours it
  by turning x-ray ON (never off — a camera move shouldn't silently un-glass
  a viewer's plates). Without it the button would tween to a solid dial back;
  with it, the star and jumper read through the glassed dial. Verified in the
  live app: the target lands on the stud at world `(−6, 0, −4.75)`, x-ray
  flips to On, and the cluster is centred.

### Half 2 — the guided demo (the scripted-user engine)

The `Demo` button runs a small step list through a shared engine (see §17 —
the engine was built here as the concrete case and generalised there, one
step-runner, not two). `DEMO_STEPS` (`src/main.js` ~6219):

1. `preset: 'Setting'` at `scale: 0.3` — frame + slow down.
2. `crown: 'out'` — waits for `crownPullT > 0.95` (the stem reaches the
   setting position); the seconds hack and fly to zero for free, both §1.
3. `turnMinutes: 4` — feeds a scripted setting turn (see below) so ~4
   detents snap out.
4. `crown: 'in'` at `scale: 1` — the jumper lifts, the watch runs on.

- **Setting turns travel the gears (rule 2).** A turn step converts minutes
  to crown rotation with the movement's OWN chain, exactly as §9's sync does:
  `(minutes·60·MIN_HAND_RAD_PER_SEC)/HAND_RAD_PER_SET_RAD`, fed onto
  `crownRotation` at `SCRIPT_SET_RATE` — itself derived from
  `SCRIPT_SET_MIN_S = 0.7 s` per detent (a beat is ~0.2 s and the snap eases
  over `CAM_SNAP_TAU = 0.06 s`, so 0.7 s/min leaves a clear gap between
  snaps), not a hand-picked rad/s. The feed is gated on `crownPullT > 0.5`
  so it can only ever drive the setting path, mirroring `tick()`'s own gate.
- **Real-time snap, on purpose.** The turn is fed on real dt, so — like the
  snap ease it triggers — the detents play at real cadence regardless of the
  time-scale slider. This is the slow-motion fork the plan flagged: slowing
  the snap would need a scripted multiplier on `rawDt` in that one easing; it
  reads fine at real speed since the snap is the point, so it was skipped.

**Acceptance (met).** Verified unattended via the deterministic frame hook
(`__clock.advanceFrame`, added because rAF is fully paused in a backgrounded
automation pane): the demo runs 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → done, crown out at step 2
(`leverEngage` 0.99, `balanceRate` 0.05 — hacked), the turn produces **5
distinct whole-minute detents** (start + 4 snaps) advancing exactly 4
minutes and landing on an index, and it ends **running** (`balanceRate` 1.0,
crown in). The `Setting` button tweens to the framed, x-rayed cluster.

## 17. Guided tour — §5's demo generalised (BUILT)

**Goal.** A first-time viewer is *shown* what to try instead of being handed
24 controls. The tour is §5's guided-demo pattern generalised: a longer list
of declarative steps driven by the SAME engine — one step-runner, not two.

### The shared engine

`scriptEnterStep` / `scriptUpdate` / `scriptStart` / `scriptStop`
(`src/main.js` ~6101–6216) interpret a step's declarative fields:
`preset`, `scale`, `crown` (`'out'`/`'in'`), `turnMinutes`, `wind`, `sync`,
the view toggles (`xray`, `labels`, `powerflow`, `sound`), `explode` (eased),
`unit`, plus `caption` and `dwell`. On enter the immediate setters fire
(toggles, then camera, then crown/turn/sync — so a preset's `reveal:'xray'`
can be overridden by an explicit `xray:false` in the same step). Each frame,
the step's *dynamic* actions must settle — crown reaching position, the turn
spent, a wind drained, a sync run all the way through catch-up, the explode
eased in — before the `dwell` clock starts; then it advances. The caption
renders in a single bottom banner (`#clock-caption`, ~pointer-events:none so
a click still reaches the canvas and cancels).

**`DEMO_STEPS` and `TOUR_STEPS` are the only two lists** (~6219, ~6229);
there is no second state machine. The tour's jumper stop even reuses the
demo's own `crown`/`turnMinutes` vocabulary verbatim, proving the reuse.

### Interaction contract — §9's `syncCancel`, generalised

Any real user input ends the script at once: `scriptStop` is armed on
capture-phase `pointerdown`/`keydown`/`wheel` on `window` while a script
runs, and disarmed when it stops. A click on the Guided buttons themselves
is exempted (`e.target.closest('.script-ctrl')`), so those toggle the script
rather than cancelling it. A script never dispatches DOM events — it calls
the underlying functions — so a captured DOM event is always the user taking
over. Like `syncCancel`, `scriptStop` STOPS rather than undoing: whatever the
script last set stays. The one thing it must release is a mid-flight scripted
sync's catch-up rate (it calls `syncCancel`), or the movement would keep
running fast with no script to end it.

### The stops

Intro (whole movement, reset to a clean view) → escapement at `scale: 0.05`
(with §12's honest readout narrating "20.0× slow · 0.25 beats/s", relied on
rather than a parallel indicator) → winding (`wind: 16` at `scale: 1` — the
chain climbs the fusee cone) → the going train with power-flow on → x-ray +
explode with labels → the dial-side jumper, operated via a pull/turn/push
inline (the demo's vocabulary) → sync to the wall clock → sound → outro
(everything reset, watch running).

**One derived-constant bug found and fixed in verification.** The winding
step first inherited the escapement step's `scale: 0.05`; auto-wind drains in
*sim*-time, so at 0.05× a ~2 s wind stretched to ~43 s. Setting the winding
step's `scale: 1` explicitly (with the constraint in a comment) brought it to
3.7 s.

**Acceptance (met).** Verified unattended via `__clock.advanceFrame`: the
tour runs all 11 stops 0 → … → 10 → done in ~37 s, each framing its subject
with a caption and dwelling, and ends **running** (`balanceRate` 1.0). A
`keydown` mid-turn and a `pointerdown` during the sync catch-up each cancel
cleanly (script null, caption hidden, `balanceRate` settles to 1.0 — no
runaway catch-up).

**Battery.** Both §5 and §17 add no geometry and no parts — no `MECH_GRAPH`
entries — so the cost was boot + visual check with the inspector kept green:
support 0 failures, clearances 0 violations, full
`inspection {includeExcluded:true}` 0 FORBIDDEN, boot console clean.

### Deep links — the same two surfaces, from a URL

`applyDeepLink()` (`src/main.js` ~6354, run once at boot) reads the query
string onto the **same** two surfaces the Guided buttons drive: the script
engine (`?tour` / `?demo`) and the raw view state its steps set (`?preset`,
`?scale`, `?xray`, `?explode`, `?labels`, `?powerflow`, `?sound`, `?unit`,
`?crown`, `?reserve`). No new code path — the state params go through the very
setters `scriptEnterStep` calls, so a link like `?preset=Escapement&scale=0.05`
reaches the pose a script step would and then just sits there as ordinary
interactive state. `?demo=1` starts the matching script exactly as its button
would.

Ordering is deliberate. State params apply **first and unconditionally**,
before the `?tour` / `?demo` branches return, because a script's steps only
touch the fields they name (`TOUR_STEPS`/`DEMO_STEPS` never set
`barrelWindTurns`) — so a base like `?tour=1&reserve=0.3` survives into the
tour instead of being skipped. Malformed input is inert: `goToPreset` no-ops
on an unknown name, and unparseable numbers fall back via `|| ` (1 for scale,
0 for explode/reserve) — nothing throws on a bad link. `?reserve` is a
fraction of the 30 h bank (`RESERVE_BARREL_TURNS`), the same 0..1 vocabulary
`__clock.setPose`'s `p.tension` already uses, so the barrel has somewhere to
wind *to* on load instead of starting flat against the full stop.

**The tour is gated; state params are not.** `?tour=1` goes through
`askTour`'s confirm/skip overlay (`#clock-tour-gate`) before anything runs — a
deep link is not itself a user gesture the way a button click is, and must not
swing the camera/crown/sound unattended before the visitor has agreed.
Proceed calls the *same* `scriptStart(TOUR_STEPS, …)` the button uses. The
state params are lower-stakes (applied once, no camera sweep, no sound) and
need no gate.

**Audio needs a real gesture.** A restored, deep-linked, or scripted
`sound:true` can call `setSound(true)` with no trusted event behind it, and
autoplay policy then leaves the `AudioContext` `suspended` forever — §8's
`sndClick` drops every tick with nothing on screen to say why. Two fixes:
capture-phase `pointerdown`/`keydown` on `window` resume the context on the
next real input whatever it is; and `scriptStart` creates/resumes it
synchronously inside the tap that launched the script, rather than waiting for
whichever step first sets `sound:true` (which runs frames later out of
`scriptUpdate`, well outside any trusted event — exactly the resume that gets
silently ignored).

**A latent restore bug `?reserve` exposed — and closed.** `crownRotDelta` in
`tick()` is `crownRotation − lastCrownRotation`, but on load `crownRotation`
was restored from saved state while `lastCrownRotation` stayed `0`. The first
tick then replayed the *entire* restored crown history as one positive delta,
which the winding path (`barrelWindTurns += …`) clamped to full on frame one.
That silently re-wound a drained reserve on **every** reload — invisible only
because `barrelWindTurns` was normally *also* restored to full, so the phantom
wind re-clamped to the same number. `?reserve` is the first caller to start
the barrel *below* full, so the phantom wind erased it. Fix: seed
`lastCrownRotation = crownRotation` in the restore block, so the first tick
sees a zero delta. The restored angle is input already delivered to the gears
last session (and already reflected in the restored `barrelWindTurns` and hand
offset), not new turning — measuring the delta from `0` double-applies the
whole history. Adds no geometry; the battery verdicts are unchanged.

## 15. The UI panel now fits a phone (BUILT — PR #3)

**Goal.** `#clock-ui` is usable on a phone.

**What was wrong.** The panel was `width: 240px` at fixed `top/left: 14px`
with no `max-height` and no scroll, carrying 24 `.row`s plus four `<hr/>`
rules, the camera presets row, and the state buttons. On a 667px-tall
viewport the bottom of the panel — Finish and State — sat off-screen and
unreachable. The Hide/☰ chip could push the panel out of the way but was
itself useless while small: nothing let you *use* the lower controls.

**What shipped — both the floor and the real fix, not just the floor.**
The backlog scoped a minimum (scroll floor) and a real fix (collapsible
sections). Both landed together in one pass:

- *Scroll floor.* `#clock-ui` gained `max-height: calc(100vh - 28px)` and
  `overflow-y: auto`, so the panel can never exceed the viewport and
  scrolls internally instead.
- *Collapsible sections.* Every control row is grouped into a native
  `<details>` disclosure — **Time, Camera, View, Finish, State** — with
  only **Time** open by default (`open` attribute). The panel now opens
  compact and the viewer discloses what they came for. The four `<hr/>`
  dividers and the `#clock-ui hr` rule they used are gone, replaced by a
  `.ui-section` `border-top` between sections (suppressed on the first, to
  avoid doubling the divider under the `<h1>`).

**Deviation from spec: `box-sizing: border-box` was required, and added.**
The backlog wrote the floor as exactly `max-height: calc(100vh - 28px)`.
That number is correct arithmetic (14px inset top + 14px bottom) *only* if
it sizes the whole visual box — but `#clock-ui` is default `content-box`,
so the raw floor sizes the content box and the 14px padding + 1px border
then push the rendered box ~30px past the intended inset. The panel's own
bottom lands below the fold and the lowest controls stay unreachable **even
with `overflow-y: auto` on**, because the scroll container's bottom edge is
itself off-screen. Adding `box-sizing: border-box` makes the 28px mean the
whole box, which is what the spec's arithmetic assumed. Measured on the
running app at 375×667: default (Time only) bottom at 551px; all sections
open, bottom at 653px and the body scrolls; the Save button (last control
in State) is on-screen after scrolling to the bottom — the exact control
the old layout buried. Side effect of border-box: content width narrows
240→~206px; presets wrap one button later, verified cosmetically fine.

**It stayed 0-logic, as estimated.** No behavioral JavaScript changed: no
event handlers, no open/close state machine, no measurement code — native
`<details>` owns the disclosure state, which is exactly why it was chosen.
Every `id` and `class` is preserved verbatim, so the existing
`querySelectorAll('#clock-ui .presets button')` and the ~30
`getElementById` wirings (pause, crown, sync, explode, labels, x-ray,
power-flow, sound, light, flute, save/load/clear) bind unchanged. The one
structural edit outside markup: the dynamically-built State section changed
from `document.createElement('div')` to `createElement('details')` plus a
`.ui-section` class, purely so it folds like the template sections — still
zero added logic.

**Reused by §23.** The `.ui-section` / `summary` styling — custom `▸`
disclosure marker that rotates 90° on `[open]`, hover state, section
borders — is the disclosure mechanism §23 was told to reuse, built once
here rather than inlined.

**Source.** All in `src/main.js`: the scroll floor on `#clock-ui`
(`box-sizing` + `max-height`, ~4918), the `.ui-section` disclosure styles
(~4927), the sectioned panel markup (`panel.innerHTML`, ~4986), and the
appended State `<details>` (~5800). Each site carries a `BUILT §15` comment.

Cost as built: PR #3 was +110/−66 in one file; net new markup + CSS is
~40–70 lines (the balance is existing rows re-indented into section
bodies), 0 logic, 0 geometry, no `MECH_GRAPH` entries · Battery: none —
pure UI/DOM, no parts and no geometry to sweep.

**Acceptance (met).** On a 375×667 viewport the panel opens within the
screen with only Time expanded; opening every section scrolls internally
rather than overflowing; Finish and State — unreachable before — are
reachable; every original control still responds (ids/classes unchanged);
boot console stays clean. Verified in the live app, not only in isolation.

## 24. Alarm — synthesized dings, set from a second crown (BUILT)

**Goal.** The watch dings a slow bell volley when the display crosses a
settable hour, using nothing but WebAudio synthesis (same standing as §8/§11
— no audio assets), and the hour is set the way a real mechanical alarm
watch sets it: from a **second, independent crown** driving a small alarm
disc, never a UI control writing the target directly (Standing Rule 2 —
angles travel the gears).

Three interface options were weighed in the roadmap against the real keyless
code. **Option A — a second, independent crown** — shipped. Option B (a
third position on the existing time stem) and Option C (a rotating bezel)
were both recorded as considered-and-declined; the reasoning is at the end.

### The ding engine

**`sndTone` — a pitched voice, not a filtered click.** Every existing timbre
(`SND.beatEvent`, `.pawl`, `.hammer`, `.stem`) is a band-passed *noise burst*
through `sndClick` — right for a mechanical thunk, wrong for a bell. So the
alarm gets one new primitive beside `sndClick`: `sndTone(freq, decay, gain,
when, emitter)`, **two lightly detuned sine oscillators** (±4 cents, a faint
beating shimmer) into one exponential-decay `GainNode`, through the same
`masterGain → masterCompressor → destination` chain, the same
`sndSpatial(emitter)` snapshot, and the same `soundOn`/`audioCtx.state`
guard as every other source. `SND.alarm` schedules **six dings across 0.42 s
offsets** (a leisurely ring), each a two-partial strike (an A6-ish
fundamental under a softer octave-down partial), spatialized to the gong's
ringing end (see the striker below) — the same offset-scheduling idiom
`SND_BEAT_EVENTS` uses for a beat's cluster, just far longer-spaced.

**Trigger — a prev-value crossing edge, not a "fired today" flag.** Inside
the existing sound edge-detect block (`if (soundOn && !fastForward &&
syncPhase !== 'catchup')`, which already supplies the `soundOn` gate and the
fast-forward / sync-catch-up suppression the acceptance requires), the volley
fires on the frame whose displayed time crosses the set target *forward*,
gated additionally on `alarmOn`. This is the same one-shot idiom the
beat/detent already use (`alarmPrevSec`, reset to `null` in the block's
`else` branch so re-arming after a mute/FF gap stays silent until the next
real crossing) — no separate "already fired today" flag is needed. A large
forward "advance" is a backward hand-set wrapping the period, not a real
crossing, so it is ignored.

**Deviation from the roadmap: the 12-hour period, not `mod 86400`.** The
roadmap wrote the crossing as `displayedSeconds() mod 86400`. But the dial
and `formatTime` are **12-hour** (`DIAL_PERIOD_S = 43200`) and carry no
AM/PM, so a 24-hour alarm could not be set unambiguously from this face. The
alarm therefore wraps on the same 12 h period as everything else it is read
against.

**Panel.** A new `<details class="ui-section">` "Alarm" (the View section's
pattern): an `id="btn-alarm"` On/Off toggle (mirroring `setSound`/`setXray`)
and a **read-only** readout of the set time, derived from the disc angle via
`formatTime` (hours:minutes — the target quantizes to the quarter hour, so
seconds are always `00`). The panel only *arms* the alarm; it never writes
the target — that is set by turning the alarm crown (Rule 2).

### The second crown and the friction-set disc

**Where it sits — scanned, not eyeballed.** 12 o'clock is the reserve and
6 o'clock the small seconds, both on the vertical axis, so the free slots are
dial-local 3 and 9 o'clock. The *side* is chosen the way §1's `JMP_AZ` picks
a bearing: score each candidate by angular clearance from the **winding
crown's stem** (which lies along `uWind`, world ≈ 145°; the dialFace Y-flip
mirrors world x, so its dial-local bearing is `atan2(uWind.y, −uWind.x)`) and
take the clearer. That is dial-local **9 o'clock** (world +x, 145° away from
the winding crown). The well radius is derived, not chosen: the largest that
leaves a comfortable band of dial (`ALARM_WELL_GAP = 3.0`, well above the
single `CLEAR_MARGIN`, because two silvered recesses closer than that read as
one blurred cut) to each neighbour well on the perpendicular axis. The well
renders in the same family as reserve/seconds via a new `kind: 'alarm'`
branch in `makeDial` — a light 12-hour ring with Arabic hour figures and
quarter-hour ticks (a clock face in miniature). The alarm well is also fed
into `JMP_AZ`'s obstacle scan so the minute jumper still avoids it.

**Three units, not the roadmap's two.** The roadmap sketched `'Alarm crown'`
+ `'Alarm disc'`. As built the disc arbor is split into its own registered
unit so the bevel mesh is a *real swept pair between registered units*, not a
contact hidden inside one group — more honest than the two-unit sketch, and
mirroring exactly how the power reserve decomposes (hand on the dialFace, its
train on the movement side):

- **`Alarm disc`** — the pointer, riding in the well like the reserve hand;
  its dialFace rotation IS the set time read against the ring.
- **`Alarm setting arbor`** — the disc arbor carrying the mating bevel and a
  lower bearing collar; the friction-set link from crown to disc.
- **`Alarm crown`** — crown + free stem + a bevel at the stem's inner end; a
  force source, exiting the case rim (no sliding pinion, no clutch — it drives
  one thing, so it is *simpler* than the winding crown it copies).

**The coupling — a real 90° bevel pair.** The crown turns the disc through a
1:1 bevel corner (the `addBevelCorner` idiom §1's setting arbor already uses):
the horizontal stem meets the vertical disc arbor at a right angle where the
two exit-radial and disc axes cross. Rotation is threaded through in `tick()`
with the same representational coupling the setting/reserve arbors use, 1:1 and
continuously — the whole assembly (crown, stem, bevel, arbor, pointer) turns in
lockstep.

**Friction-set, not detented — and why (a bug the battery missed).** The first
build gave the disc a 48-tooth detent star + click-spring. It passed every
inspector check, and it was wrong: the star sat at z −2.3…−1.6, *buried in the
base plate* — because the base plate is not a labelled unit, so the overlap
sweep never tested anything against it (one of the two structural blind spots
`TODO.md` already names). The narrow band between the plate (bottom −2.3) and
the well floor (−6.5) cannot fit a 48-tooth star clear of the plate, the stem,
and the bevel. The fix is also the more authentic mechanism: real alarm watches
(Vulcain Cricket, JLC Memovox) **friction-set** the alarm hand — no click
detent. So the star and click-spring are gone; the disc holds wherever the
crown leaves it and is READ to the nearest quarter mark on the ring
(`ALARM_MARK_STEPS = DIAL_PERIOD_S / (15·60) = 48`, a derived reading
resolution, not a tooth count). Setting is smooth and silent. The bevel was
also shrunk and its corner lowered to −4.1 so the stem bevel clears the plate
and the disc bevel clears the well floor with `CLEAR_MARGIN` — verified by hand
against the un-swept base plate (arbor 1.8, crown 0.35). The arbor's lower pivot
runs in the well floor bore (a bearing collar), which is its route to `Dial`
(itself grounded) in the support graph — the star's collision had been silently
*satisfying* the old `Alarm setting arbor → plate` support edge.

### Angles travel the gears

`alarmCrownRotation` is the raw drag input (parallel to `crownRotation`,
written by an alarm-crown drag handler with its own hit-test — the winding
handlers are registered first and take the pointer when they hit, so the two
crowns never both capture). The pointer renders the disc angle *continuously*
(friction-set), and **`alarmTargetSeconds` is DERIVED** from that angle — the
nearest quarter mark, `round(angle) · 43200/48` — never assigned by the panel.

### The striker — a visible source for the sound

The disc only *sets* the alarm; nothing about it makes a noise. So the ding
gets a real source: a **gong** — a steel wire arc (`Alarm gong`) fixed to the
back (three-quarter) plate by a single foot, its far end ringing free — struck
by a **hammer** (`Alarm hammer`) pivoted just beyond that free end. Both sit in
the clear upper sector of the movement back (az 45–135°, away from the balance
and escapement in the lower-right), above the plate top, where a real alarm
gong lives. The bell voice spatializes to the gong's ringing end (an empty at
that point, since the gong unit's own origin is the movement axis and would
mis-place the sound at the centre), and the gong + hammer glow as it rings.

The strike is **representationally driven**, like the rest of the movement:
`SND.alarm` stamps `alarmRingStartMs`, and `frame()` swings the hammer a
half-sine onto the wire once per ding, in sync with the tones — its head closing
a 0.4-unit rest gap onto the ring. The strike direction (which way the pivot
rotates the head onto the wire) was *measured*, not guessed. It is frame-driven,
not posed by `setPose`, so it stays at rest through the entire inspector battery
— which is why `Alarm hammer`/`Alarm gong` are supported but carry no drive
edge and never trip the undriven check. What this model does **not** build is
the alarm's own power: a real Memovox has a second mainspring and striking train
driving the hammer. Here the hammer is shown and its motion is honest; its power
source is the one piece left for later.

### Persistence — and a bug fixed alongside

`captureState()` already *emitted* `soundOn`, but `state.js`'s `defaultState`
/ `sanitize()` **omitted** it, so it was stripped before saving and
`restoredSound` was effectively always false. Fixed (one line each) while
adding the alarm's own persisted fields. The alarm persists `alarmOn` and the
**raw `alarmCrownRotation`** (not the target): the disc angle and
`alarmTargetSeconds` re-derive deterministically, so a reload lands on the
exact same setting (Rule 2).

### Battery (clean)

Five units — `Alarm disc`, `Alarm setting arbor`, `Alarm crown`, `Alarm gong`,
`Alarm hammer`. Support 0 failures · graph clean (all grounded; the setting
chain — via a new `'alarm'` pose axis sweeping `alarmCrownRotation` through a
full disc revolution, with `'Alarm crown'` a new drive source — is attributed
to the alarm crown and *only* the alarm crown; the gong and hammer are static
under every pose axis, so they carry no drive edge) · full `inspection
{includeExcluded:true}` **0 FORBIDDEN** across 45 pairs (every alarm pair
EXPECTED) · clearances 0 violations · boot silent. The blind spots the sweep
structurally cannot see were measured by hand: the base plate is not a swept
unit, so the whole alarm mechanism was measured against it directly (all clear);
the hammer's strike onto the gong is a frame-time contact (verified by
measurement, not posed).

### Acceptance

Alarm On + hour set via the alarm crown → at that time `soundOn` plays a slow
multi-ding bell volley (not a click), spatialized to the gong, which the hammer
visibly strikes once per ding; Alarm Off → silent; fast-forward across the
target → silent (§8's FF rule). The disc's angle and `alarmTargetSeconds` agree
to within one quarter mark in both directions (verified across the range). State
save/load round-trips the hour and the toggle (7:45 + armed survived a reload,
re-derived to the same setting). Boot silent; full battery clean.

### Options B and C (considered, declined)

**B — a third position on the existing time stem.** `crownPullT` is not an
N-position selector; it is a continuous eased slide gated into two zones by
one threshold, and the minute jumper's lift keys off that *same* threshold.
A third position means widening the travel, adding a second threshold, and
re-deriving every `crownOut`/`crownPullT` read site per zone — while still
building the same alarm disc Option A needs anyway. Strictly more code and
more regression surface for the identical user-visible result. Not built.

**C — a rotating bezel.** `plateR` is a computed movement *envelope*, not a
case wall; there is no case, crystal, or caseback mesh today (BACKLOG §3,
deferred). A bezel is a ring on a case with nothing to attach to yet.
Parked on §3 rather than built as a case-less placeholder.


## 25. Alarm striking works + the full alarm complication (BUILT — branch claude/alarm-wind-clutch)

**Context.** §24 shipped the alarm as a real complication (second crown,
friction-set disc at 9 o'clock, gong + hammer) AND made the striker
honestly SPRING-POWERED in logic (public repo, PR #6 / branch
`claude/alarm-second-crown`, commit `50c258e`): a dedicated alarm barrel
`alarmBarrelWind` (turns) drains while ringing, the hammer angle is
DERIVED from a striking-train phase `alarmStrikePhase` that the draining
drives, one ding per whole strike, and the ring STOPS when the barrel
runs down (Rule 2 — see `tick()`'s "Alarm: release + spring-powered
strike" block, `alarmHammerAngle`, and `SND.alarmStrike`). The RELEASE
trips on the hour position crossing the set position; the `Alarm` toggle
gates it. `__clock` exposes `alarmBarrelWind` / `alarmReleased` /
`alarmStrikePhase` / `alarmHammerAngle`.

**What is still MISSING is the visible geometry** for that power chain —
today the alarm barrel, the striking train, the release feeler/lock, and
the alarm-crown winding are all logic with no parts. This entry is that
geometry, so a viewer can SEE the striker draw its energy, see it get
scheduled, and see it armed/disarmed. It mirrors how the going train is
already built (spring `barrelWindTurns` → drains as the balance turns →
gates `balanceRate` → `τ` → whole train), just for the alarm.

**A — alarm barrel + striking train. BUILT** (public repo, branch
`claude/alarm-striking-works`). Reconciled against what actually shipped:

- *A barrel and a striking wheel now stand on the plate top*, in the clear
  band outboard-left of the balance that the gong already claims. `Alarm
  barrel` is a new FORCE SOURCE in `MECH_GRAPH` (node `'alarm mainspring'`,
  the counterpart of `'mainspring'`); `Alarm striking wheel` carries its
  pinion. Both sit on studs planted in the 3/4 plate top — the gong post's
  idiom. Barrel 44 t ⇄ pinion 11 t, a 4:1 step-up at module 0.3.
- *The striking wheel is a lifting CAM, not a pin wheel* — the one real
  departure from the sketch above, and worth knowing WHY before anyone
  "fixes" it back. A pin lifts the hammer's tail by sliding out along its
  face and letting go at the tip; the hammer then falls and its face sweeps
  straight back down through where the pin still is. The pin only escapes
  radially (≈1.7 units per radian of wheel) while the hammer falls its whole
  draw in a fifth of a pin pitch. Measured: the tail buried itself 0.21–0.47
  into the pin it had just released, and thinner pins, a slower fall and tip
  relief all failed to shift it. A clean escape needs the tail to cross the
  pin circle steeply — and steep crossing and small draw are the SAME
  parameter, so it wants ≈60° of hammer swing, against §24's hammer resting
  0.4 off the gong on a 7-unit arm. A cam and follower never lose contact on
  the rise, so there is nothing to escape from.
- *The profile is GENERATED from the lift law*, not the other way round:
  sample the rise, put the nose where the law says, record where that lands
  in the wheel's own turning frame. Four lobes, 62 % rise (smoothstep), then
  the flank drops away and the hammer falls under its own spring — that free
  fall is the strike. Draw = 3 × `ALARM_STRIKE_AMP`. (Trap: the generated
  psi is already in the wheel's frame. Re-zeroing it on the release — the
  obvious tidy-up — puts every lobe a full radian off the nose that is
  supposed to ride it.)
- *The hammer gained a TAIL* whose wheel-facing side tapers from full width
  at the pivot to nothing at the point. Not styling: a parallel bar with a
  symmetric nose buries its wheel-facing SHOULDER 0.36 into the rising
  flank, because the shoulder stands nearer the wheel's centre than the
  point does. The taper puts every part of that edge further out.
- *`ALARM_RING_SECONDS` is now an OUTPUT.* §24's 6 s was a free constant no
  train can deliver at a 0.42 s cadence without the barrel creeping through
  a third of a turn. The constraint is now that the barrel must visibly
  unwind more than one revolution: `ALARM_BARREL_TURNS = 1.75` → 16 strikes
  per barrel turn → 28 strikes → ≈11.8 s. `ALARM_STRIKE_DUR` is gone, and
  restored state clamps `alarmBarrelWind` (older saves hold §24's 8).
- *The striker's pose moved from `frame()` into `tick()`*, so the inspector
  can pose it at all. New `'alarmStrike'` axis, `n: 109` — deliberately
  coprime to the 28 strikes, or every sample lands on the same few phases
  within a lobe and steps over the strike entirely.
- *New penetration budget* `['Alarm striking wheel','Alarm hammer']`, which
  earned its keep immediately: it is what caught both defects above, in a
  pair the overlap sweep is structurally blind to (EXPECTED is granted per
  unit PAIR). Calibrated at 0.12 — a cam follower TOUCHES, and `mtvDepth`
  resolves a tangential contact badly; a correct build reads 0.094 and the
  number falls ≈1:1 with an artificial shrink of the tail, reaching 0 at 0.1.
- *`makeBarrel` gained a `ratchet` option.* The alarm barrel ships with NO
  ratchet or click: there is no winding path until stage C, and a click
  riding round with the barrel it is meant to hold is a display fiction.
- *Cost:* the back stack grew from 10.2 to ≈12.1. The cam has to sit under
  the barrel — a pinion always sits closer to its wheel than the wheel's own
  tip radius, so the cam unavoidably passes over the barrel and the two can
  only be separated in z. Worth carrying into §2.

Battery at landing: support 0 · graph clean · penetration all within budget
· `inspection {includeExcluded:true}` 0 FORBIDDEN · clearances 0 · boot
silent.

**B — release mechanism.** A reduction train from the hour wheel
(`hourWheelGroup`, `mwHourA` = 1 rev / 12 h) to a 12-hour cam COAXIAL with
the alarm disc at 9 o'clock — the same span-crossing pattern as the
power-reserve train (`reserveTrain`). The set disc carries a notch, the
hour cam a finger; a feeler drops when they align and lifts a locking
lever off the striking wheel. The lock is what the shipped `alarmReleased`
flag now embodies; cross-check the cam alignment against the existing
angle crossing.

*After A:* the lock now has something real to hold. `alarmStrikePhase` is
parked at `ALARM_PHASE_REST` (the instant a lobe's rise begins, lift 0)
whenever the lock seats, so a locking lever wants to bear on the striking
wheel at that phase and free it at the trip. Note also that A left the
striking wheel's own bearing stud static and its rotor separate — the lever
has a static face to be pivoted against.

**C — alarm-crown wind/set clutch.** Mirror the time crown's
sliding-pinion clutch (`windSpinner` / `crownPullT` / `windPathRot` /
`setPathRot`, one-way ratchet banking `barrelWindTurns` in `tick()`): a
second sliding pinion on the alarm stem + `alarmCrownPullT`; PUSHED IN
winds `alarmBarrelWind` through an alarm crown wheel + ratchet, PULLED OUT
drives the disc through the existing bevel (today's setting path). An
alarm-crown pull/push toggle (like `toggleCrown`). `MECH_GRAPH` drive
`['Alarm crown','Alarm barrel']` (wind) + `['Alarm crown','Alarm setting
arbor']` (set). When this lands, change `alarmBarrelWind`'s default from
full to 0 — the alarm must be WOUND to ring.

*After A:* the barrel is built and `ALARM_BARREL_TURNS = 1.75` is what the
crown has to bank into, through whatever winding reduction the crown wheel
gives. The barrel deliberately carries no ratchet or click yet
(`makeBarrel({ ratchet: false })`) — this stage adds them, and the click
must be mounted on the PLATE, not on the barrel group, or it turns with the
thing it is holding. The crown will also need a second force-source route
in `MECH_GRAPH`, alongside the `'alarm mainspring'` node A added.

*Winding-route design, RESOLVED (the geometry study that has to happen before
any code, done — branch `claude/alarm-wind-clutch`, off the §13 tree).* The
naïve picture (dial-side crown → drop straight down to the barrel) is
IMPOSSIBLE here, and it took measurement to prove rather than assume:

- §25 A sited the alarm barrel on the plate top at world az ~173, r ~23 —
  directly OVER the fusee, great wheel, drum and chain, which fill the entire
  z-column beneath it. A winding arbor cannot drop from it.
- A full clear-column sweep of the movement (excluding the plates, which get
  bored for arbors) finds NO clear vertical channel within a gear-mesh of the
  barrel. The nearest clear column is ~15 units away, in the lower-left gap.
  Placing the barrel anywhere on its own mesh circle around the striking wheel
  does not help — the striking wheel is pinned near the hammer (upper-left),
  so every barrel position that meshes it sits over the going train.
- The crossing is therefore unavoidable: the power source (barrel, windable
  near a front crown) and the sink (hammer, on the back) are on opposite faces
  with a solid movement between. §25 A already paid the EASY crossing — barrel
  and striking wheel are both on the plate top, meshing laterally, no z-cross.
  The winding is the HARD crossing and needs a real route.

Two architectures for the STRIKER were weighed with the owner. **Rejected:
move the whole striker to the dial front.** It co-locates everything (no
crossing) but reworks all four shipped §25 A parts AND clutters the visible
dial (the owner wants the dial face clean). **CHOSEN: keep §25 A's striker on
the back untouched; make only the winding cross, through the one clear
channel.**

*The SETTING indicator — design history and the CURRENT design.* This went
through three owner-steered revisions; recording all three because each was
killed by a MEASUREMENT, and the reasons are load-bearing for whoever builds:

1. ~~§24's sub-dial disc~~ (shipped, being replaced): a 5 mm well cramps the
   12 h scale into a tiny arc — poor setting precision.
2. ~~Peripheral "orbiting train" ring at the railroad radius~~: precise
   (12 h spread over the full dial) and prototyped to an approved look — a
   subtle steel lozenge seated between the chemin-de-fer's rails (measured off
   the dial TEXTURE: the rails render at world r 31.5/34.2, not the nominal
   0.87/0.94·dialR — the canvas silver fill only reaches ~0.92R). But the
   RING behind the dial is blocked: at the keyless cluster (az 120–160°) the
   yoke and setting lever reach z −6.8, leaving 0.2 of the ≥0.45 a ring +
   margins needs above the dial plane (−7.0). A front-side floating ring on
   dial rollers was designed around it (and is still viable), but was
   superseded by 3 before build.
3. **CHOSEN — central rattrapante alarm hand.** A co-axial hand at the dial
   centre riding its own tube around the hour-wheel tube, just dial-ward of
   the hour hand. DISARMED, it mechanically FOLLOWS the hour hand — a true
   rattrapante return: heart cam on the hour wheel, spring-loaded follower on
   the alarm tube — so it hides exactly under the hour hand, invisible.
   ARMED, a clamp holds the alarm tube at the set time and the follower
   lifts; the hand stands at the alarm hour like a Tudor Advisor / Memovox
   pointer. Setting (crown pulled) drives the tube against the clamp-open
   state through a small train from the alarm corner.

   Why this converges beautifully: the rattrapante centre IS stage B's
   release. With the hour wheel and the alarm tube co-axial, "hour crosses
   set time" is a physical alignment at ONE axis — the classic Memovox
   architecture (notched cam + drop pin) falls out of the same parts, instead
   of needing a separate 12 h comparison train at 9 o'clock.

   Measured constraints for the build: the dial-gap disc (z −7.0..−6.3) is
   crowded — small-seconds display arbor crosses r 6.8–15.8 (its own azimuth),
   keyless works r 10.1–12.8, minute jumper r 12–12.6, reserve train r 11–16 —
   so the drive train from the alarm corner (r ≈ 15.4) to the centre must
   thread the az ≈ 0 corridor (measured passable). Centre surgery: the dial's
   centre bore (currently HOUR_TUBE_OUTER + 0.2) must open to pass the alarm
   tube; the tube wraps the hour-wheel tube with running clearance; the hand
   rides between the dial face and the hour hand. The heart cam mounts on the
   hour wheel (1 rev/12 h, the correct period by construction); the follower
   and clamp live in the dial gap near the centre.

   The §25 C prototype marker (revision 2's look) was removed from the tree
   when 3 was chosen — one indicator, not two.

**BUILT (branch `claude/alarm-wind-clutch`, four verified stages — this is
what shipped, reconciled against the plan above):**

1. *Centre stack* ✔ — alarm tube around the hour-wheel tube (its running fit
   IS the bearing), enlarged dial bore, steel rattrapante leaf under a
   LENGTHENED hour hand (0.5R → 0.56R, tip one unit shy of the numerals'
   measured inner edge; the minute hand moved to 0.83R, tip ON the measured
   rails). The z-budget forced two real changes: the whole hands stack rose
   0.7 (hour+minute together — at the old plane the free lane was thinner
   than any hand section, and the first mount GRAZED the blade through the
   dial sheet), and `makeHand` grew stacked-hand overrides (boreR/bossR/
   bossH — a bored collet that passes the inner tubes; defaults bit-identical
   for every existing hand). §24's sub-dial well is healed; the dialFace
   mirror bit once (a world-frame calibration put 5:00 at printed 7 — the
   printed numerals are the only reference).
2. *Heart cam + sprung follower* ✔ — the rattrapante follow. The follower
   co-rotates with the SETTING, so its swept envelope is an annulus, and the
   lane behind the dial is bounded at r 4.5 by a dial foot + the motion-works
   stud (vertex-probed): everything lives inside r ≤ 4.3 — shallow heart
   (rMin 2.75 → R 3.55; makeHeartCam gained an rMin override since the
   classic 0.32·R notch would fall inside the tube bore) and a short arm
   whose length + seated angle are derived from the same triangle tick()
   solves. Follower pose is Rule-2 derived (heart profile → law of cosines,
   two fixed-point iterations for contact-azimuth drift) and was verified
   against the closed form at four relative angles. New penetration budget
   ['Hour wheel','Alarm disc'] on the (now ARMED) alarm axis: 0.082/0.12.
   The CLAMP was NOT built as a lever — arming is the friction coupling in 3
   holding against the follower spring; the visible on/off lever remains D's.
3. *Setting train* ✔ — crown → bevels → arbor pinion (10) → plain idler (31)
   → setting wheel (30) FRICTION-riding the tube (armed: wheel ≡ tube to
   1e-9; disarmed: 1.12 rad of measured slip — the cannon-pinion precedent).
   ONE module for all three meshes (m·(30+2·31+10)/2 = ALARM_CD ≈ 0.302 —
   a plain idler cannot span two modules; the first plan wrongly borrowed
   the reserve train's two-module split, which needs a COMPOUND idler).
   The quantizer bug this exposed: alarmMarkIndex read the RAW crown angle
   (correct only at 1:1) — one crown rev read 0 h instead of 4 h. §24's
   arbor collar (riding a well-floor bore that no longer exists) became a
   plate cock; support edge 'Dial' → 'plate'.
4. *Winding path* ✔ — with a cleaner clutch than planned: the stem's own
   pull throw (CROWN_PULL_DIST) carries its sliding bevel from the setting
   corner to the CLIMB ARBOR's contrate one throw outboard — the pull IS the
   clutch, no separate sliding pinion. (The planned az-205 channel died with
   the sub-dial relocation; the climb lives at az 0, r = ALARM_CD + throw,
   rising through BOTH plates — base-plate bore + jeweled TQ pivot, the
   plates' holes hoisted with an assert since they build first. A raycast
   overruled a sparse vertex probe that claimed the TQ plate was absent
   there.) Up top: pinion + two 59 t idlers cross the vertex-probed-empty
   z 10.1..11.6 lane to the barrel rim, i2 by two-circle intersection.
   Idlers drop out: crown → barrel = 12/44, full wind ≈ 6.4 crown turns.
   `alarmBarrelWind` defaults 0 — the alarm ships unwound. NO CLICK, a
   deliberate deviation from the plan: in §25 A's single-member barrel
   (rotation IS wound state) a click would block the ring itself; the hold
   is B's lock, and the arbor/shell split that earns a real click is filed
   as debt. Winding banks wind AND un-rides the cam in lockstep (the exact
   mirror of the ring's spend), and the three phase RESETS (trip, run-down,
   switch-off) are GONE — each silently slipped the barrel⇄cam mesh.
   Verified: wind → trip → 28-strike ring lands the phase at exactly REST
   with no reset anywhere. The winding train's pose derives rigidly from
   the barrel angle, so it visibly free-spins during the ring — what rigid
   meshing implies, and what real alarm crowns famously do.
5. *tick() + UI* ✔ — crown deltas route by where the bevel physically is
   (`alarmCrownPullT`); the SET path (`alarmSetRot`) holds while winding and
   persists; pull toggle + wind-percent readout; `setAlarmCrownRotation` /
   `setAlarmCrownOut` on `__clock` for inspection parity.

**B + D — BUILT (same branch), reconciled:**

- *B, the hold:* a brake lever on the plate top (probed-clear az-160 sector
  by the striking wheel) — pivot post, steel arm, ruby pad on a new smooth
  LOCK COLLAR under the striking cam. A brake, not the sketched notched
  detent, because the winding lockstep can park the train at ANY phase —
  the stop-lever-on-balance-rim precedent. Verified: lifts by exactly the
  derived ALARM_LOCK_LIFT at the trip, re-seats to 1e-4 after run-down.
- *B, the release:* the CONVERGENCE the entry predicted came true — the
  feeler IS the rattrapante follower. The trip now derives from the
  physical alignment (wrapPi(mwHourA − alarmTubeShownA) crossing zero =
  the nose dropping into the heart's notch), §24's seconds-space
  comparison retired, its guards carried into angle space. The rod from
  the centre follower up to the plate-top lever is NOT built — declared
  in MECH_GRAPH.todo as the remaining §25 coupling debt.
- *D, the switch:* a two-position blued slide behind the lock's tail: OFF
  presses the brake closed regardless of the feeler, ON backs its 0.9
  throw away. btn-alarm eases it; pose path exact. Power-flow gained the
  alarm groups (winding lights crown-train + barrel as STORE; ringing
  lights barrel → cam → hammer → gong as DELIVER).
- *Battery for the new contact:* the alarmStrike axis now poses
  alarmOn + alarmReleased (a turning train IS a ringing one — an engaged
  pad under a spinning collar would be a false dig), and a clearance
  budget proves the lifted pad clears the turning collar by 0.22 ≥ 0.15
  through the whole ring.
- *Also:* an 'Alarm complication' explode GROUP (the §10 level-1 seed):
  per-group layer staging unfolds all ten alarm units in torque order,
  labels filter to members, boot-asserted against real label names.

*Crown-sense swap — DONE (owner's call):* pushed-in WINDS, pulled-out
SETS, the Cricket/Memovox convention. The two vertical arbors exchanged
radii; the setting train re-solved and then re-solved AGAIN when the full
sweep and the owner's own eyes caught what focused runs and an EXPECTED
blanket had hidden: a collinear idler impaled on the climb, an idler
poking through the reserve sub-dial's wall, and the setting wheel crossing
BOTH well walls since stage 3. Final geometry: asymmetric 28 t/37 t idlers
on a dogleg threading the (slightly shrunk, wellR 10.9 → 10.2) well rings,
the climb and the cock — every clearance boot-asserted, because the two
failure paths (a probe that skipped the Dial unit; an EXPECTED row
blanketing the sweep) are structural and asserts share neither.

*D, revised twice more (owner-driven):* the slide switch became a COLUMN
WHEEL (steel, ratchet skirt, castellations cut by the same profileAt the
poses ride), with a CLICK/detent arm whose tangential geometry rocks its
nose radially — 1.78 riding a column (OFF), 1.30 dropped in a gap (ON),
derived not picked — and a case PUSHER whose pawl indexes the skirt, since
a cased movement cannot reach a plate-top wheel (§3's case band bores for
its stem). Tap targets: the wheel, the click, the pusher cap, the alarm
crown (pull/push toggle), plus the panel buttons. An interference audit
prompted by the owner's eye fixed the stud-through-crown, skirt-on-plate,
pawl-in-plate, boss-in-plate and beak/nose-through-castellation set.

*Also:* an 'Alarm complication' explode group (§10's level-1 seed) unfolds
all ten alarm units in torque order with labels; arming SWEEPS the hand out
(τ 350 ms, the re-coupled friction wheel) while disarming SNAPS it home
(τ 60 ms, the spring) — the two speeds are the two mechanisms.

*Still open before the PR leaves draft:* the final full sweep on the
B+D tree, moving this entry to `docs/BUILT.md`, and the PR description.
*True remaining debt:* the follower→lock release rod, and the barrel
arbor/shell split (the honest click).

**D — on/off lever + power-flow.** A visible on/off lever the `btn-alarm`
toggle drives (holds/frees the lock; `setAlarm()` animates it). Extend the
power-flow view (`pfBuildGroups`) with an alarm group so the barrel →
striking train → hammer torque path lights while ringing — the visual
proof it is spring-powered.

*After A:* the torque path exists as real parts and real `MECH_GRAPH` drive
edges (`alarm mainspring → Alarm barrel → Alarm striking wheel → Alarm
hammer`), so the group is a lookup rather than a story. A already lights the
striking wheel alongside the gong and hammer on each strike
(`SND.alarmStrike`'s `sndFlash` targets).

**Traps carried from §24.** The **base plate is NOT a swept unit**, so
every new part must be measured against it by hand (the bug that buried
§24's first detent star). Same for the 3/4 plate top where the back-side
parts sit. The movement is crowded; geometry fitting is the bulk of the
work and is iterative against the live battery.

Feasibility: large (a full second complication in a crowded movement) ·
Cost: A came to ~330 lines across `main.js` / `geometry.js` / `inspect.js`;
B–D likely another ~300–400, still mostly iterative fitting · Battery:
full, and best landed A→D with a checkpoint after each — support 0, graph
clean, `inspection {includeExcluded:true}` 0 FORBIDDEN, clearances 0, boot
silent. A's lesson for the rest: the overlap sweep will NOT catch a bad
contact between two units that are already declared EXPECTED, so every new
working contact wants its own penetration budget, written before the
geometry is trusted. A fuller written plan (the 5-stage
version, of which Stage 1 already shipped) was drafted as
`~/.claude/plans/cozy-wandering-boot.md` on the machine where §24 was
built; this entry is the durable copy.
