// Mechanical Clock Simulation — LAYOUT SPEC (BUILT §13, step 1).
//
// The movement's geometry is genuinely parametric — barrel at the origin,
// everything stepped off it through real wheel radii — but for most of the
// project that parametricity lived tangled in `main.js`'s evaluation order:
// 6,400 lines of module-level `const` where a number could not be moved
// without knowing everything downstream of its line. §13 untangles that into
// a pure data module the builders CONSUME. This file is the first slice: the
// constants that were already pure — no `THREE`, no `scene`, no solved
// positions, just numbers DERIVED from constraints with the constraint in the
// comment. Everything here is exported as plain data; nothing here builds or
// mutates anything.
//
// Rule as this module grows: a value belongs here iff it can be computed from
// literals and other values in this file alone. The moment it needs a wheel's
// measured bounding box or a solved position it stays in `main.js` (for now —
// later steps of §13 pull the solve out too, into a `solveLayout(spec)` this
// file will host). The geometry fingerprint (`inspect.js`) guards the move: a
// pure relocation of these definitions must not change a single part's world
// position, so the hash is identical before and after.

// TORNADO Z-stack — compressed to a 1.7-unit wheel stride (the old uniform
// 3-unit staircase was half air). The three offsets expressed as formulas
// are real mechanical constraints, not styling:
//  · L_FORK = L_ESCAPE + 1.5 — the fork body's underside just clears the
//    escape wheel's top face while the stones (stoneZReach below) straddle
//    the tooth band;
//  · L_BALANCE — the balance now sits IN the three-quarter plate's z-band
//    (the classic Glashütte elevation: rim level with the plate, swinging in
//    the cutaway), derived below so its rim's underside binds exactly one
//    CLEAR_MARGIN above the fork body's top face;
//  · L_HAIRSPRING and the flat balance cock ride the balance.
// Stride 2.1 is the floor set by the BRIDGES, not the wheels: each cock is
// a centred slab ±(width·0.2 + bevel) thick, and it must fit between its
// own wheel pair's planes and the next wheel up that crosses it (solved:

// from the nest-under-the-escape era — slack the fusee now needs: the
